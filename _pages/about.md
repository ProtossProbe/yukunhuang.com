Welcome to my academic homepage. I am currently a Project Research Fellow at [CfCA](https://www.cfca.nao.ac.jp/) [NAOJ](https://www.nao.ac.jp/en/), working with Prof. [Eiichiro Kokubo](https://www.cfca.nao.ac.jp/~kokubo/). My research interests span a broad array of topics within dynamical astronomy. These include celestial mechanics, Kuiper Belt objects, and the formation and evolution history of the Solar System.

I completed my PhD from UBC Dept. of Physics & Astronomy under the guidance of Prof. <a href='https://www.astro.ubc.ca/people/gladman/'>Brett Gladman</a> in 2023. Prior to this, I achieved my Master's degree in astrodynamics with distinction from Tsinghua University in 2019.
